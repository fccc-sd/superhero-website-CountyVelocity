          <p>
            <strong>Shintaro Kazama (風間 新太郎, Kazama Shintarō)</strong> was the captain of the Dojima Family 
            and the patriarch of its subsidiary, 
            the Kazama Family, which later became a direct subsidiary of the
           Tojo Clan. He is the proprietor of Sunflower Orphanage. <br>
           Kazama began his life in the yakuza around the age of twenty
            as a hitman for the Tojo Clan, gaining a reputation for being
           an incredibly skilled, cold-blooded assassin and accumulating
           a sizable body-count. <br>
           Despite his infamy as a merciless killer, Kazama's regret over
            his killings eventually drove him to open the Sunflower Orphanage,
           where he would finance the upbringing and education of all the children
            of his victims. Kazama would also often visit the orphanage and spend
            time with many of the children, becoming like a foster father to them.
            One of his children was a boy named Matsumara. 
            At some point after Matsumara grew up and moved out, Kazama took in
           orphans Kazuma Kiryu, Akira Nishikiyama and Yuko Nishikiyama, and Yumi
            Sawamura, and grew very close with them.

         <p>
          <strong>Osamu Kashiwagi (柏木 修, Kashiwagi Osamu)</strong>  is the 
          former captain and interim chairman of the Tojo Clan, the former captain 
          and later second patriarch  of the Kazama Family, and the founder 
          of the Honest Living Association. He currently resides in Isezaki 
          Ijincho as the proprietor of Survive Bar. <br>
          Kashiwagi is a stern but responsible man who likes to violently
          discipline his subordinates for any foolish mistakes they make.
          He is something of an older brother figure to Kazuma Kiryu 
          and Akira Nishikiyama, the adoptive children of Kazama,
          despite them being in the Dojima Family and not the Kazama Family directly. <br>
          He also prefers working behind the scenes as a
          second-in-command rather than a full leadership position.<br>
          Kashiwagi is regularly shown to love cold noodles and is described as being terrifying
          when he couldn't eat them. Whenever he went out to restaurants with Kiryu,
          he always ordered cold noodles and would force Kiryu to buy the ingredients
          if they ran out.

          <p>
            Akira Nishikiyama is the the patriarch of the Nishikiyama 
            Family and adoptive brother of Kiryu Kazuma. <br>
            Akira Nishikiyama grew up in Kazama's Sunflower 
            Orphanage along with Kazuma Kiryu, Yumi Sawamura, 
            and his sister Yuko Nishikiyama. <br>
            In 1985, Nishkiyama joined the Dojima Family along with his best friend Kiryu, 
            despite excessive protests and even a beating from Kazama. 
            Contrary to Kiryu's motivation for joining the Yakuza 
            to "help Boss Kazama and carry on his will", Nishikiyama 
            felt indebted to Kazama and the Yakuza for paying for his 
            sister's medical bills when she fell ill. Even though both 
            brothers were frequently involved in fights, both feel 
            self-gratified in this new criminal lifestyle.

          <p>
            Morning Glory Orphanage is an orphanage located opposite a beach in Okinawa. 
            The institution hosts eight local children plus Haruka Sawamura and 
            is managed by Kazuma Kiryu, though the land belongs to Shigeru Nakahara. <br>
            Morning Glory Orphanage opened between 2005 and 2007. It has ties to a similar institution 
            called Sunflower Orphanage, where Kiryu was raised during the 1970s and 1980s.
            When the former manager passed away and he was asked if he knew anyone to take
            on the job, Kiryu volunteered himself, as looking after kids was something he
            wanted to do after his father figure and Sunflower proprietor Shintaro Kazama
            did the same. <br>

            Kazuma Kiryu (桐生 一馬, Kiryū Kazuma), 
            also known as Joryu (浄龍, Jōryū), and Taichi Suzuki 
            (鈴木 太一, Suzuki Taichi), is the former primary protagonist of the Like a Dragon 
            (formerly Yakuza) series. He is currently an agent of the Daidoji Faction, 
            the former fourth chairman of the Tojo Clan, 
            the former manager of Morning Glory Orphanage, 
            former taxi driver for Nagasu Taxi, former manager of Four Shine Sotenbori 
            and a casual guest manager of Four Shine Tokyo.

            Kiryu's legendary accomplishments and ascent
            through the ranks of the Tojo Clan's Dojima Family,
            as well as the dragon tattoo on his back,
            have earned him the nickname "The Dragon of Dojima" (堂島の龍, Dōjima no Ryū).

         <p>
            Kiryu's tattoo covers most of his back, ending just above his thighs.<br>
            It depicts a white, gray, black, and red "Yinglong" or "Oryu"WP grasping
            a pearl, symbolizing power, wisdom, protection, and balance in Japanese culture.<br>
            The pearl also contains the Sanskrit character for the year of the monkey, 
            relating to Kiryu's Chinese zodiac year (1968). <br>
            Ferocious and brave protectors, dragons are typically associated with
            hot-tempered individuals, though Kiryu's silver-colored dragon also suggests 
            purity of heart. <br>
            During the events of Yakuza 0, only the outlines of the tattoo
            are present, but it has been seen in its completed state since then. <br
            The colors of red, white, gray, and black mirror the colors of Kiryu's iconic outfit. <br>
            Utabori is the tattoo artist who designed Kiryu's dragon, 
            and his signature (歌彫) is displayed on the left-hand side of the design.

         Kiryu loves working with kids, and is a good caretaker to the children at Morning Glory Orphanage.
         Genuine and understanding, he bonds with the children through their shared experiences.
         He treats them all as fairly as possible, going out of his way to keep them all safe and happy, whether it means staging a wrestling match to cheer them up, or refusing to sell the land even in the face of a large sum of money.
         He also shows fondness for arcade games, believing that nobody is too old for them.
